                    <h4>MAKAPANS VALLEY HERITAGE SITE</h4>
                    <div class="tabContent">
1.	MAKAPANS VALLEY HERITAGE SITE

The Makapans Valley heritage sites are situated on the farm “Makapansgat” some 19-km east north east of Mokopane in Limpopo. The Makapans Valley is unique in that one kind find preserved in its many caves, in the form of sediments, fossils and archaeological remains, a record of human occupation and resource exploitation extending from australopithecine (ape-man) period about 3.32 million years before present through to present. This evidence forms the foundation of the South African prehistoric sequence.  Nowhere else within the confines of a single valley can such an extended and complete record of hominid activity be observed.  The most important sites in the valley are as follows:<br><br>

<strong>• The Makapansgat Lime works and adjacent "Cave of the Horse's Mandible"</strong>
	This is the oldest of the sites, spanning the time range of about 3.3.2 BP to about 1,6 BP. This site has yielded hundreds of thousands of fossil bones amongst which were found the remains of the gracile (lightly-built, smaller) australopithecine (Australopithecus africanus)<br><br>

<strong>• The Cave of hearths and adjacent "hyaena Cave"</strong>
	Cave of Hearths preserves the stone tools and other debris left by early man who first occupied the site at around 250 000 BP.  The overlying beds preserve an intermittent but extremely long record of human occupation, from +- 100 000 - 50 000 BP and again from 10 000 - 5 000 BP, and from iron age times to the present century.  It appears that between 200 000 BP and 100 000 BP the COH remained unoccupied.
	Fossils from the adjacent "Hyaena Cave " where the sediment infill is of greater age, suggest affinities with the Limeworks via occurrence of the remains of similar primitive hyaenas at both sites.<br><br>

<strong>• The Historic Cave of Makapansgat</strong>

	The Historic Cave lies immediately adjacent to the COH and preserves Iron Age and Mfecane relics, but is most famous as the scene of a clash between a Boer Commando and local Langa and Ndebele people.  Chief Makapan (Mokopane), together with a large number of his people and their livestock were besieged in the cave for nearly a month between 25 October and 18 November 1854 by Andries Potgieter.<br><br>

<strong>• The Rainbow Cave</strong>

	This lies immediately below the eastern chamber of the Historic Cave and contains the remains of several hearth, distinguished as different coloured ash and sediment horizons and hence the name of this little "cave".  The Rainbow Cave in all probability represents the lower part of the infill of the eastern chamber of the Historic Cave.  The exposed sediments have yielded Middle Stone Age artefacts of the Polokwane culture, in the age range +- 100 000 - 50 000 BP.
	The COH and Hyaena Cave, Historic Cave and Rainbow Cave together from part of a single interconnected large cavern complex, different portions of which were open to the surface and available for occupation at different times.<br><br>

<strong>• Peppercorn's Cave</strong>

	The cave contains Iron Age and recent relics, and an underground lake, which Mr Peppercorn utilizes as a source of water.  It is also home to a large colony of migratory long-fingered bats.  (Miniopteris schreibersii)<br><br>

<strong>• Ficus Cave and the Ficus Iron Age Site</strong>

	The cave contains Iron Age and 19th Century relics, a large bat colony and an underground lake of fluctuating depth.  An Iron Age site in the saddle between the Ficus Cave ridge and a small isolated hillock directly opposite the entrance, preserves occupational debris dating from +- 550 AD (early Iron age), ± 870 AD, and 1560 AD. As well as relics of Late Iron Age inhabitants who used the site immediately prior to white settler occupation.  The slopes adjacent to the saddle are artificially terraced containing archaeological finds.<br><br>

<strong> • Buffalo Cave</strong>

Dr R Broom took a small collection of fossils from the breccia of this remnant cave n 1937.  The breccia has yielded the remains of an extinct fossil buffalo, but the cave has been little studied and its contents remain undated.

                    <h4>Mapungubwe</h4>
					<div class="tabContent">
						<p>Mapungubwe was declared as National monument on 17/08/84. Mapungubwe as an archaeological site received prominence in the 1930's with the discovery of golden ornaments and artefacts.  Mapungubwe is situated approximately 2,5 km south east of the confluence of the Shashi- and Limpopo rivers, on the farm Greefswald.  Mapungubwe consist of Bushveld sandstone and is approximately 300 meters long, it has a flatcrown vertical wreathe of some 30 meters high. The hill itself has an elongated shape, with 80 metre high cliffs surrounding the greater part of its periphery.  Access to the top of Mapungubwe is not easy, and there are only seven known ascents, of which only one is reasonably safe to use in both directions.<br><br>

Gold that was found in a graveyard on top of the hill, where 33 burials were discovered, each of which had a variety of golden beads, bangles and other golden decorations entombed with it.  In view of the fact that there were no burials with gold discovered elsewhere, it is clear that an aristocracy was living on top of Mapungubwe Hill.  Further archaeological evidence confirms this, and changes that took place socially, politically and culturally started the processes that led to the beginning of the system of divine kingship evident at Great Zimbabwe.<br><br>

Settlement structure at Mapungubwe places the hill at the centre, with the town spread out, around it.  There was clearly a demarcated main entrance for visitors to enter, which led them past houses to the foot of the hill where the court was situated between large upright boulders.  Excavations have uncovered steps, terrace walls and directional walls which clearly demarcated this area from the rest of the town.  It is generally accepted that the main way up to the top of the hill was through the court, and that there were several guards whose duty it was to limit access to the top of the hill, thus ensuring that the king was not disturbed.  We can be certain that the ruler lived up here, as it is not accepted in such a manner that commoners would look down upon his residence.  He also had to reside close to the court.  Evidence of the existence of the leader is non-existent and of other early villages, this is indicative of the fact that the ruler now has other priorities to which he must attend and can no longer be bothered by ordinary problems. Unless his advisors and councillors could not solve the problems, people wishing to see him would first have to get past all these officials before being granted and audience.  Numerous archaeological sites of these old villages are still to be seen along the Soutpansberg, extending deep into the heart of present-day Venda.  At about 1250 AD it appears as if the town of Mapungubwe was abandoned for reasons still unknown.<br><br>

The importance of Mapungubwe lies in the first manifestation in Southern Africa of a class-based society as opposed to a rank-based one prevalent earlier, and this led ultimately to the rise of the Great Zimbabwe Empire.
